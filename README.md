# I want you to experiment with the code that you can find by typing the following

arm_motor.
gyro.
# Remember you can put you mouse over a command for more information
# Feel free to experiment and see what things do (have someone ready to catch the robot)
# If you want code to temporarily not run you can put the # symbol in front of it or
# Press Ctrl + / while on the line or multiple lines selected
# See below if you want to get information from the robot (angles, or other information) to print to the screen
# Can you get the robot to: drive in a square 50cm on each side.
#                           drive around the triangle
#                           Cuboid
# You might want to google python loops

### How can I see information from the robot
```python
robot.angle()
arm_motor.angle()
gyro.angle()
```
You may have found the above commands which will give us information from the robot and it's sensors
However if you just type this in it will not do anything
We need to tell python to display this information
We can do this 2 ways
```python
print(robot.angle())           # Will display the estimated robot angle to the output of window in VS Code
ev3.screen.print(gyro.angle()) # Will display the gyro angle on the robot screen
```
The other issue we have is this will only happen once and then not give an updated value we can use a loop to continue to show us the current value
```python
while True:
    arm_motor.run(200)
    print(arm_motor.angle())
```
This will run the arm motor slowely and display the angle to the screen (press the stop â—» other wise this will run forever)
```python
while True:
    gyro.angle()
```
